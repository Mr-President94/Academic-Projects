# Data Science

A repository for my mini projects of Machine Learning in R and Python

There are many small datasets that I have worked on but not posted here because I truly believe that the insight of a concept is more important than a code. Until and unless you understand the basics of an algorithm and have domain knowledge, then only you can show off your coding skills.

The repository above is an example of what I have said above. Although there are a lot of people who posted their work on similar looking datasets but what I have tried and implemented are the techniques in data sceince in a simplified format.
