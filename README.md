# Data Science

A repository for my mini projects of Machine Learning in R and Python

The goal of making this repository is to understand the fact that the knowledge freshers have to apply in a practical job and the knowledge they gain there is going to be completely different from what was taught in a classroom. And one can only master at a particular field by doing it practically rather than just by reading about it.

There are many small datasets that I have worked on but not posted here because I truly believe that the insight of a concept is more important than a code. Until and unless you understand the basics of an algorithm and have domain knowledge, then only you can show off your coding skills.

The repository above is an example of what I have said above. Although there are a lot of people who posted their work on similar looking datasets but what I have tried and implemented are the techniques in data sceince in a simplified format and tried explaining best to my knowledge.
