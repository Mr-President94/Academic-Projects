On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragedy shocked the international community and lead to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck lead to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Objective:
The main objective of the dataset is to Predict who survived the sinking ship by applying various Machine Learning Algorithms. 0 for dead 1 for survived.

Some of the steps done were - 
1. Converting some character variables to factor
2. Understanding the significant variables from the summary of the Classification model
3. Scaling the numeric columns
4. Understanding Simple concepts of Libraries in R
